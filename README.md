# DONATION_WIKI data viewer
! This directory contains a small static web app that renders donation information
! for privacy- and freedom-focused projects.

! The **runtime data** used by the app now lives in `README.md`.

! Data format (`README.md`)

! Projects are stored as plain text blocks separated by a blank line:

! ```text
! <Name>
! <Short description>
! Updated: <YYYY-MM-DD or free text>
! <METHOD_1>: <address or URL>
! <METHOD_2>: <address or URL>
! ...
! ```

! - The first line is the project name.
! - The second line is a short description.
! - An optional `Updated:` line indicates when the entry was last touched.
! - All following non-empty `Key: Value` lines are treated as donation methods
!   (e.g. `XMR: <address>`, `Fiat: <URL>`, `BTC: <URL>`).

! The web app parses this structure and renders each project as a card with
! copyable crypto addresses or links.

! Where to edit the list

! - To change what the **app displays**, edit `README.md` in this folder.
! - To contribute to the canonical public list, use the GitHub link in the
!   header (`Add or update the list`), which points to the upstream repository.

! Future: Multipay script to automatically pay from a local crypto node to the projects in the list.
